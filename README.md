## ðŸŽ¥ Dataset Struture
We construct a new public comprehensive movie-trailer dataset (CMTD) for movie trailer generation and future video understanding tasks. We train and evaluate various trailer generators on this dataset. Please download the CMTD dataset from these links: [CMTD](https://gyglim.github.io/me/vsum/index.html).
Due to movie copyright issues, we cannot provide the original movies. The dataset only provides the features extracted by [ImageBind](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ImageBind) after we segmented the movie shot and audio shot using [BaSSL](https://github.com/kakaobrain/bassl).
